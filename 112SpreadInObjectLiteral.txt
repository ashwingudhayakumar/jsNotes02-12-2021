const ariana={songs:'yes',acting:'yes'};
const selena={songs:'yes',acting:'no'};

const combine={...ariana,skills:'yeah'};//songs :'yes',acting:'yes',skills:'yeah';

if same key means order matters atlast what we wrote only comes


[...combine]//error//object cannot spread in array //for this one solution is nested object literal into array[{...combine}] this works

{...[4,5,6]}//{0:4,1:5,2:6};
