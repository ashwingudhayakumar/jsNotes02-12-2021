write 5! using reduce

[1,2,3,4,5].reduce((accumulator,currentValue)=>accumulator*currentValue);


const grades=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7];
const max=grades.reduce((accumulator,currVal)=>accumulator>currVal?accumulator:currVal);//7

Math.max(3,5);
5 but this is for values not array so max used into reduce by


const max=grades.reduce((accumulator,currVal)=>Math.max(accumulator,currVal));//if min want means just Math.min()


//reduce can be also written by  arr.reduce(callback,initialValue);


[10,20,30,40,50].reduce((sum,currVal)=>sum+currVal,0);
                                                   |-----initial value
